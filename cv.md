that are equal to one in the binary
 representation of that number. 
 You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010,
 so the function should return 5 in this case
```
var countBits = function(n) {
  return n.toString(2).replace(/0/g,'').length;
};
